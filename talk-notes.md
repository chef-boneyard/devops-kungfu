<h1>Devops</h1>
<ul>
  <li> The war for definition
  <li> The resistance to a definition
  <li> The filling of the vacuum
  <li> Devops comes from the lived experience of the practitioner
  <li> Making it, in all cases, unique to the practitioner
  <li> We had a lot of overlapping experiences though
    <li> Relationship to failure
    <li> High trust, high interaction relationships with each other
    <li> A penchant for automation
    <li> A tendency towards self reliance
    <li> Obsession with metrics and graphs
    <li> A focus on revenue and availability
</ul>
</slide>

<slide>
<h1>Devops and the struggle for definition</h1>
<ul>
  <li> I think the struggle to define devops comes from this nature
  <li> You can look at an individual, and see the 'school' they came from
  <li> If you look at the 10 people I worked with longest, they way they 'do devops' is very, very similar to mine
  <li> Its not suprise - our experiences are very similar
  <li> The further you go from there, the more small differences there are
  <li> In general, the macro trend holds - you can see us all under one umbrella, with many small differences
</ul>
</slide>

<h1>Kung fu is like that</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Gōngfu (功夫)
  <li> 功 (gōng) meaning "work", "achievement", or "merit",
  <li> 夫 (fū) which is alternately treated as being a word for "man" or as a particle or nominal suffix with diverse meanings (the same character is used to write both)
  <li> Originally, it did not mean just to practice martial arts
  <li> It referred to the process of ones training - the refinement of body and mind, the learning and perfection of your skills
  <li> The excellence achieved through long practice in ones skills

<slide>
<h1>Many styles of Wushu</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Hundreds of different schools
  <li> They vary widely on what they emphasize
  <li> But the broad methods are the same
    <li> Basics - the fundamental internal/external foundation
    <li> Forms - a series of predermined behaviors that can combine to a continuous way of acting
    <li> Applications - using your Kung fu in the field, and adapting the basics and forms to your situational awareness
  <li> When you see someone doing it, and you are broadly ignorant, you know its different than boxing
  <li> When you are someone who knows it well, you can tell the differences right away
  <li> Sound familiar?

<slide>
<h1>We need to understand Devops like we understand Kung fu</h1>
<ul>
  <li> There is a deep well of practical philosophy
  <li> There is a broad base of experience, unique to each individual
  <li> We are recognizably similar
  <li> There is a way to teach people how to do it
    <li> It starts with the basics, and everyone must master them
    <li> It moves to Forms - predetermined behaviors that can be combined into continuous sets of actions
    <li> It ends in Application - actually doing your Kung fu in the field, using what you have learned
  <li> TMTOWTDI is true and honest and important
    <li> However - if you don't know how to do it, you could probably skip the 15+ year journey of difficulty
    <li> And practice the basics, learn the forms, and apply them in your life
</ul>
</slide>

<slide>
<h1>We can and often do argue about what it means</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Those arguments might change what overall makes a form
  <li> But they don't change its nature
  <li> We have a common language and pallete for expression of our ideas
</ul>
</slide>

<slide>
<h1>This is my Devops Kung fu</h1>
<ul>
  <li> I call it "Chef Style"
  <li> It comes from my experience
    <li> As a systems administrator
    <li> As a software developer
    <li> As an entrepreneur
    <li> As an executive
    <li> As a human being dedicating my adult life to the internet
    <li> As a father
  <li> It draws on many important influences
    <li> Mark Burgess
    <li> John Allspaw
    <li> Christopher Brown

  <li> This talk is my foundational document of that Kung fu
  <li> Once you have watched it, you can join my school
  <li> We can develop the basics, our forms, and help on application
  <li> Talib Kweli explained to me that artists amplify the movement they see in the world
    <li> Marvin Gaye didn't write What's Goin On and <li>then<li> the movement happened
    <li> The movement happened, and Marvin had to respond to, and amplify it, with his art
  <li> That is my intent here - I will use my platform to raise up the voices of those who are doing the work
    <li> And we can then leverage it as a platform to help each other
    <li> And to further our aims of having our workplace be a better place
</ul>
</slide>

<slide>
<h1>I know nothing about Wushu</h1>
<ul>
  <li> I took Tae Kwon Do for a month when I was a kid
  <li> It's not even Chinese, its Korean - that's where it ends
  <li> But - my Devops Kung fu is strong
  <li> So is my Comic Book Kung fu
  <li> So I will now use exclusively Comic Book Martial Arts references

<h1>Chef Style DevOps</h1>
<ul>
</ul>
</slide>

<slide>
<h1>Breakdown of a DevOps Style</h1>
<ul>
  <li> A definition of DevOps
  <li> The principles we aspire to (How you recognize DevOps when you see it)
    <li> Wushu calls this the 'basics', but it involves a lot of pushups, and there isn't a lot of pushups in devops
  <li> The forms we use - the actual things we practice, that try and re-enforce and bolster our principles
  <li> The application - the use of those forms in our actual situation
  <li> These four things are the evolutionary arc of your practice - in the beginning, you learn from others
  <li> As you grow, you will use the forms others have used to learn about the deeper meaning and philosophy
  <li> The more you apply them in practice, the less reliant on the forms you will be - it all just becomes the natural flow
  <li> 'Do not be timid about the scope or the influence - we are re-inventing the way we run businesses'
  <li> Leading you, and anyone else, to be where those of us with already strong Kung Fu are - uniquely suited to our task
</ul>
</slide>

<slide>
<h1>Definition of DevOps</h1>
<ul>
  <li> A cultural and professional movement, focused on how we build and operate high velocity organizations, born from the experiences of the it's practitioners.
    <li> Cultural and professional - cultural like Heavy Metal, professional like Vocalist, Lead Guitar, Rythm Guitar, Drums, and Keyboards
    <li> Focused on how we build and operate - it encompasses the details of how we build things, and the details of how we operate them
    <li> High velocity organizations - because we aren't very good at operating slow moving organizations; we were built to go fast
    <li> Born from the experiences of it's practitioners - many of whom were the web innovators - because they were the first ones that had to go fast
  <li> It is a Job Description (and can be a useful signal of intent)
</ul>
</slide>

<slide>
<h1>Who cares about it?</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Everyone involved in building and operating a high velocity organization
  <li> Including, but not limited to

    <li> Software Developers (Storm)
    <li> Network Administrators (Kitty Pryde)
    <li> Security Professionals (Wolverine)
    <li> Sales Reps (Cannonball)
    <li> Product Managers (Forge)
  <li> All of these roles (and more) should practice our Kung fu
  <li> The application may be very different, but the basics and forms are the same
  <li> In this way, we are not generalists - we are highly connected specialists

</ul>

  <li> Design for re-use when you can
    <li> CERN and the LXC - one framework for four experiemnts

  <li> And it's the work of your entire career - so you've got some time to work on it

</ul>
</slide>

<slide>
<h1>Application</h1>
<ul>
  <li> The next step is application - actually doing all of these things in your organization
  <li> Given a long enough application, you will develop your own style - what works, what doesn't, what vocabularty you choose

</ul>
</slide>

<slide>
<h1>Where do you start?</h1>
<ul>
  <li> While we can't - and wouldn't presume - to tell you how to do it forever
  <li> We can tell you how to start tying all these things together, and gain your first experiences with what it feels like

</ul>
</slide>

<h1>The Project</h1>
<ul>

</ul>

  <li> Your discernment
  <li> Your experience
  <li> That's what the real active action is
  <li> 

  You talk about moving risk and complexity to the left and that is where it is in the kata (or tai chi form) as well. The most frequently needed/used moves are at the front, the ornate or specialized moves at the end or on the right.
