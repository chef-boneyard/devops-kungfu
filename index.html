            <h1>Devops</h1>
            <ul>
              <li> Devops comes from the lived experience of the practitioner
              <li> Making it, in all cases, unique to the practitioner
              <li> We had a lot of overlapping experiences though
              <li> Relationship to failure
              <li> High trust, high interaction relationships with each other
              <li> A penchant for automation
              <li> A tendency towards self reliance
              <li> Obsession with metrics and graphs

            <h1>Devops and the struggle for definition</h1>
            <ul>
              <li> I think the struggle to define devops comes from this nature
              <li> You can look at an individual, and see the 'school' they came from
              <li> If you look at the 10 people I worked with longest, they way they 'do devops' is very, very similar to mine
              <li> Its not surprise - our experiences are very similar
              <li> The further you go from there, the more small differences there are
              <li> In general, the macro trend holds - you can see us all under one umbrella, with many small differences

              <li> The principles we aspire to (How you recognize DevOps when you see it)
              <li> Wushu calls this the 'basics', but it involves a lot of pushups, and there isn't a lot of pushups in devops
              <li> This includes a definition of DevOps
              <li> The forms we use - the actual things we practice, that try and re-enforce and bolster our principles
              <li> The application - the use of those forms in our actual situation
              <li> These three things are the evolutionary arc of your practice - in the beginning, you learn from others
              <li> As you grow, you will use the forms others have used to learn about the deeper meaning and philosophy
              <li> The more you apply them in practice, the less reliant on the forms you will be - it all just becomes the natural flow
