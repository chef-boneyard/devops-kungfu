## Contributing

You should start by [watching the presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DEToXsgrPc), then come back here. If
you agree
with the fundamental principles, wish to practice our forms, and apply the style
to your professional life, you can join our school by sending a pull request to
this README file, and adding your name to the list of practitioners.

If you like most of what you see, but not all, or wish to emphasize different
things about your style - but you agree on the same fundamental principles - you
should fork this repository, remove the names of practitioners from this file,
and found your own school of DevOps Kung fu. All we ask is that you please give
attribution of your style as a derivative of Chef Style DevOps Kung fu.

### Bug Reports

- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:
  - Tabs to indent
  - Single-quoted strings
- Should be made towards the **master branch**
- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your master)
