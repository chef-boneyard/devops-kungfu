# Chef Style DevOps Kung fu

This repository defines Chef Style DevOps Kung fu.

It includes a presentation you can give, or ask people to watch, which explains
what DevOps is, and defines a style of practice that comes from the lived
experience of many DevOps professionals. It is a collaborative space, where all
practitioners of the style can come together to create a reference for how to
build up their own DevOps Kung fu, and teach others how to improve theirs.

You should start by watching the presentation, then come back here. If you agree
with the fundamental principles, wish to practice our forms, and apply the style
to your professional life, you can join our school by sending a pull request to
this README file, and adding your name to the list of practitioners.

If you like most of what you see, but not all, or wish to emphasise different
things about your style - but you agree on the same fundamental principles - you
should fork this repository, remove the names of practitioners from this file,
and found your own school of DevOps Kung fu. All we ask is that you please give
attribution of your style as a derivative of Chef Style DevOps Kung fu.
